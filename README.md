## Running Locally with Genkit

To use the AI features in this application, you will need a Gemini API key.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
2.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
3.  Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you obtained:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

Now the AI features should work as expected.
